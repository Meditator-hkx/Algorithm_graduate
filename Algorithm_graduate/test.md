## 1. How many types of programes are there here?

There are two types, one is java-type and another is python-type, for the reason that I am much more familiar with java but python is much more compatible with Mininet.

## 2. Why do you say Mininet?

Actually it is not a necessity to use mininet just for algorithm testing but it's just a part of work as command.
